## What is this?
A fun web-based lobby + mini-game hub:
- Real-time chat (lobby + per-game)
- Multiplayer support (join with group code or open lobby)
- Retro games: Snake, Tetris-style block drop, simple multiplayer arenas, etc.
- Spaceship cockpit UI with 3D-curved monitors, scanlines, blinking cursors, and glitch effects
- Single-player mode for chilling alone

### Tech Stack
- HTML5 + CSS3 (with 3D transforms & perspective for curved monitors)
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks — keep it lightweight)
- Tailwind CSS (for quick styling + responsive)
- Fira Code font (that sweet monospace hacker vibe)
- Future: Socket.io or Firebase for real-time multiplayer
- 
No backend yet — pure client-side for now (local play or static host).
No games yet to run i am still working on some Multiplayer Games some little adjustment then we are good to go.
